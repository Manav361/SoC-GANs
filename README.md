Enhance Low Resolution Image using GANs

Week 0:- Went through the videos of python and learned OOPs in python through the videos provided by mentors

week 1:- Went through a detailed article on "An Introduction to Deep Feedforward Neural Networks" and learned all 
         the concepts involved in neural networks thoroughly .....like different types of 
         classifications,different activation functions used, concept of gradient descent ,cost function and loss 
         function and how to minimize them...and all the type of mathematics involved in it.
         I also learned how to apply neural networks in coding using python and built a neural network in python.

week 2:- Went through the pytorch tutorials and learned applying regression models in pytorch and learned general 
         function of pytorch.


Due to high academic commitments including 5 quizzes and few assignments of tech team and PORs last 2 weeks. I  couldn't cope up with the current weeks' material but would surely be coming insync by the end of this week.

week 3:- Read the whole CNN module and implemented it in jupyter notebook


week 4:- Learned about GANs and its implementation using pytorch


week 5:- Went through the ESRGAN paper an trying to implement it.
